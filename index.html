<h1>Students' Examination Handbook</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This booklet is a brief guide to students about exams and assessment. Please make sure you familiarise yourself with its contents. Ignorance of exam and assessment requirements will not be accepted as an excuse for poor or incomplete performance. If in doubt, ask. Sources of information are listed in the Appendix.</p>
<p>Despite the apprehension exams cause for most students they are a fact of University life and form a major part of the overall assessment of student performance. The purpose of this booklet is to explain the chief features of the exam and assessment system at Aberystwyth for your benefit and ultimately that of the University. After all, the more you understand about it, the more opportunities you have to get the best out of your studies and to perform to the best of your ability. </p>

<h2>Timing of Examinations</h2>

<p>Examinations are scheduled three times a year:
<ul>
    <li>at the end of Semester 1 (January)</li>
    <li>at the end of Semester 2 (May/June)</li>
    <li>Supplementary Exams (August/September)</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<h2>Examination Timetables</h2>

<p>Provisional and Final Exam Timetables are circulated to all Notice Boards and can be consulted over the Web (see notices for details) before the Semester 1 and 2 exams. Please make sure you check the Provisional Timetables for clashes and report any to the Timetable Officer at attstaff@aber.ac.uk immediately. Failure to do so is likely to cause you major problems as special arrangements will be needed for you to sit, adding to the pressures on you at what is already a difficult time.</p>

<p>Always check the Final Timetable to see if any of your exams have been moved moved. Misreading of the timetable is not a valid reason for absence or late arrival.</p>

<p>The Supplementary Exam Timetable is published on the web for those students allowed to resit or who have missed the Semester examinations because of illness or other compassionate grounds.</p>

<p>The Semester 1 and Semester 2 Exam Timetables are worked out on the basis of the modules you registered for at the start of session, and will take into account any approved changes of module. When you change module you must complete a Change of Registration Form (available from the Academic Office, the Deans' Office or your department - or you may print a copy from your Web page) and have it approved by all the relevant academic authorities. Failure to do so may result in timetable clashes for you and complications for you when you fail to turn up to exams in modules you are no longer taking. You will only receive marks for modules on which you are formally registered. You should therefore check your registration on your web page. You may even be awarded a mark of 0 and denied an opportunity to resit your module. It is imperative that you keep the Academic Offi ce informed informed. We cannot always solve your problem if you have caused it yourself.</p>
<p>
The Supplementary Exam Timetable is based on the modules which students have informed the Academic Offi ce they intend to resit (NB you cannot resit an exam you have passed!). Please make sure you indicate on the Supplementary Exam Form your correspondence address over the summer. </p>

<h2>Exam Venues</h2>

<p>Seating Arrangements for the exams (venue and seat numbers for every paper) will be posted on Notice Boards shortly before the exams. Make sure you turn up at the right place at the right time and occupy a correct seat seat. Failure to do so will only cause you problems and lose you time in the exam room.</p>

<p>The Supplementary Exams are normally held in Aberystwyth. Exceptionally and by special arrangement they may be held in designated centres overseas, subject to all costs being met by the candidates concerned. Holiday or employment commitments over the summer will not be considered justification for absence or a reason for special arrangements to be made on your behalf. </p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>Details of exam and assessment requirements for your modules appear on the Module Database which can be consulted over the Web (www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/). More detail is provided in Departmental Handbooks. Make sure you know what you have to do and keep to deadlines for the submission of assessed work. Failure to do so may result in one or more of the following:
marks lost for late or non-submission of course work, possibly leading to a zero mark with no opportunity to represent;</p>

<strong>Note:</strong>
<ol>
    <li>In Part 2 if you fail a module overall because of late or non-submission of assessed work, you may be denied a resit at any time in the future. Even if you are allowed to resit the highest mark you may achieve is 40.</li>
    <li>HND students will lose one resit opportunity. </li>
    <li>exclusion from the exams;</li>
    <li>report to your LEA or sponsor, who may reclaim part of your loan, grant or sponsorship;</li>
    <li>exclusion from University. </li>
</ol>
<p>The Academic Regulation on Academic Progress, available on the web (www.aber.ac.uk/en/student/academic/regulations), explains the various procedures. Make sure you read it and don't fall foul of it. Further copies are available from the Academic Office and the Deans' Office.</p>

<p>Assessed course work should be presented in the correct form at and by the specified date to the designated person in each department. Please allow yourself some extra time to cover last minute problems (for example, problems with your computer files or minor illnesses such as colds, headaches etc) which may cause you to miss the deadline. You may be issued with a formal receipt in some departments which you should keep in case there is a dispute about your submission.</p>
<p>
As many students use their coursework for revision purposes it is advisable for you to keep a copy in case the work is still being marked at the time when you want to revise. All coursework which contributes towards your fi nal degree assessment (not Part 1) must be made available to the external examiners under arrangements operating in each department. </p>

<h2>Marking</h2>

<ol>
    <li>In all written examinations you must have your student reference number: this is a nine digit number, which appears on your Information Services card and in correspondence that you receive from the Academic Office. Please make sure that you have your number at hand in the examinations.</li>
    <li>Your name will be linked to your scripts only at the Departmental Exam Board, in order to allow for special circumstances (e.g. medical or compassionate grounds) to be taken into account.</li>
    <li>In case of disaster (eg failure to write your exam number on the answer book) we ask you to write your name on the answer book but to obscure it as instructed.</li>
    <li>Except where it is impractical to do so, most coursework you submit will be marked anonymously. Each department will notify students of the precise arrangements it uses for this.</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>To ensure fairness and consistency all exams and assessed work are marked in accordance with the University's policy on assessment. The policy states:</li>
    <li>Departments are required to have in place procedures designed to ensure that at every level and for every module students and markers are protected from claims of bias or prejudice on either part.</li>
    <li>These procedures will include at the very least sampling by a second internal marker of a minimum percentage, agreed in consultation with the external examiner, of the work being assessed, with particular emphasis on fail and borderline marks. In many cases, departments will double mark all signifi cant assessment elements. </li>
    <li>All work which counts towards your fi nal assessment is monitored by external examiners whose job it is to vet exam papers, monitor marking standards, participate in oral exams (where relevant) and ensure fair play for all.</li>
    <li>Your work will therefore be examined by a number of staff both internal and external to the University, avoiding the possibility of marker subjectivity or prejudice. </li>
</ol>
<h2>
Absence from Exams</h2>

<p>If you are absent from an exam you must inform your department in writing of the reasons for your absence as soon as possible and in any case before your results are confirmed, supplying corroborating evidence where relevant.</p>

<p>If you are in Part 2 and do not do so, or if the Examination Board does not accept your explanation, you will not be allowed a Supplementary Resit in that module. You will not normally be allowed to resit on any further occasion and a mark of 0 for that element will be carried through to your final assesment.</p>

<p>HND students will normally lose one resit opportunity.</p>

<p>Late Arrival at Exams
If you miss the start of an exam you should proceed to the exam venue as soon as possible. Staff there will advise you whether you can still sit the paper (if you arrive up to 30 minutes late) or whether you should follow another course of action. </p>

<h2>Special Circumstances</h2>

<p>If you believe that your performance in some or all of your modules may be affected by special circumstances (medical, personal or other compassionate grounds) you must complete the Special Circumstances Form and forward it to the specifi ed staff in departments. The information will be treated confi dentially and released only on a 'need to know basis'. See www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic/special-circumstances/ for further details. </p>

<h2>Rules for Progression</h2>
<ol><li><span>Exam conventions are used to determine progress between years of study and the calculation of degree class at the end of Honours degree schemes. The rules for progress deserve emphasising here:</span> </li></ol>
<h3>Degree Students</h3>
<h4>Part 1</h4>
<ol><li><span>You will pass Part 1 if you satisfy all the following conditions in your Part 1 examinations</span> <ol><li><span>passes at 40% or more in 80 credits' worth of modules <br/>and</span> </li>
<li><span>no marks below 30% <br/>and</span> </li>
<li><span>an overall weighted average of at least 40% <br/>and</span> </li>
<li><span>satisfy all special requirements for entry to Part 2 of your degree scheme, as specified by your departments.</span> </li></ol>
<span>Exceptionally, candidates may be allowed to progress into Part 2 with up to 20 credits' worth of failures (less than 30%).<br/>
<br/>You will not be allowed to enter Part 2 until you have satisfi ed all the above conditions (ie you will not be allowed to retake failed Part 1 modules while studying in Part 2).</span> </li></ol>
<h4>Part 2 (Years 2 and above)</h4>
<ol><li><span>To complete each year of Part 2 successfully, including the fi nal year, and to gain 120 credits towards your degree you must obtain passes at 40% or above in at least 60 credits' worth of modules each year <strong>but note</strong> the maximum number of credits you may fail and still qualify for a degree set out in 21 below.</span> </li>
<li><span>The rules for progression for Ordinary Degree and integrated Master's schemes (<abbr title="Master of Physics">MPhys</abbr>, <abbr title="Master of Engineering">MEng</abbr> and <abbr title="Master of Mathematics">MMath</abbr>) are different and will be explained by the departments offering these schemes.</span> </li></ol>
<h4>Final year</h4>
<ol><li><span>Information on the examination conventions used to classify degrees appears <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/academicoffice/Undergraduate/classification.shtml">on the Web</a>.</span> </li>
<li><span>To qualify for a degree under University Regulations you must satisfy both the following rules:</span> <ol><li><span>passes in at least three quarters (75%) of the credits counting towards your degree (<abbr title="That is">i.e.</abbr> 180 out of 240 credits for 3 year schemes or 270 out of 360 for 4 year schemes), excluding credits obtained during a Sandwich Year or Year Abroad. <br/>(<strong>Please note:</strong> In recognition of the disruption caused by industrial action in 2006, students who began part 2 in September 2005 need to pass only <strong>two thirds</strong> (66.7%) of credits counting towards the degree (<abbr title="Id Est (That Is)">i.e.</abbr> 160 out of 240 credits for three year schemes or 240 out of 360 for four year schemes). <br/>
<br/>
<strong>and</strong></span> </li>
<li><span>passes in at least two thirds (66.7%) of the credits taken at the level of award, as follows:</span> </li></ol></li></ol>

<h2>Results</h2>
<ol><li><span>Details of the dates on which results will be issued are emailed to all students and posted on notice boards. <br/>
<br/>Results are issued as follows:</span> <ul><li><span>Semester 1 accessed via your 'Student Record' which can be accessed from the Aberystwyth Front Page, <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> address: <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/student/index.php">www.aber.ac.uk/en/student/</a></span> </li>
<li><span>Semester 2 as for Semester 1 above and by mail to your home address</span> </li>
<li><span>Supplementary Exams by mail to the address you supply</span> </li></ul>
<span>It is your responsibility to ensure you receive your results. If in any doubt ask the Academic Office but note that <strong>results will not be released over the phone</strong> <br/>
<br/>If you change address during the year or want your Semester 2 results sent elsewhere <strong>you must inform the Academic Office by 1 June at the latest latest</strong>. The Office may charge for duplicate sets of results if you have moved and not told us!</span> <br/>
<br/>You must also pass modules defined as <strong>'must pass'</strong> in your departmental handbooks.</li></ol>
<ol><li><span>Your notification of Undergraduate results will contain the following information: <br/>
<br/>Your Reference Number, Name and Study Scheme, Module ID and short title, Mark (%), Comment. <br/>
<br/>The comments currently in use are:</span> </li></ol>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<table><tbody><tr><td>X</td>
<td>No Exam (<abbr title="For Example">e.g.</abbr> thin module).</td></tr>
<tr><td>R</td>
<td>Must resit (less than 30%).</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td>
<td>(30-39% - Only 40 credits' worth of these can be accepted for completion of the year).</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td>
<td>Absent (you must resit).</td></tr>
<tr><td>M</td>
<td>Allowed to resit on medical, compassionate or other special grounds - No Fee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td>
<td>No Resit (No Supplementary Exam allowed. Your failure is due to non-submission of compulsory coursework, uncondoned absence from an exam or unfair practise. You must repeat the year in whole or in part before proceeding into Year 2. You may resit as an internal or part-time external student only when the module is next examined.)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3>Part 2</h3>
<table><tbody><tr><td>X</td>
<td>No exam (as Part 1 above)</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td>
<td>Fail (less than 40%). The highest mark attainable on a resit is 40%. You cannot resit in August but may resit on one further occasion when the module is next examined, normally the following session. If you substitute another module the maximum mark obtainable is still 40%.</td></tr>
<tr><td>H</td>
<td>Resit for Full Marks either in August or the following session (the actual mark obtained in the resit will count) - No Fee.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A</td>
<td>Absent (you may resit on one further occasion, but the highest mark attainable is 40%. You may resit only in the following session).</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td>
<td>No Resit at any time in the future. (Your failure is due to non-submission of compulsory coursework, uncondoned absence from an exam or unfair practice. The mark awarded will be carried forward to your degree assessment, with no opportunity to resit.)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3>HNC/HNDtudents only</h3>
<table><tbody><tr><td>W</td>
<td>Referral in written work</td></tr>
<tr><td>E</td>
<td>Referral in examination</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td>
<td>Referral in both written work and examination</td></tr>
<tr><td>H</td>
<td>Resit for Full Marks</td></tr>
<tr><td>L</td>
<td>As a consequence of not submitting coursework and/or non-attendance at an examination, you have lost one of your two resit opportunities. Accordingly, the next opportunity to resit will be your last.</td></tr>
<tr><td>N</td>
<td>As a consequence of not submitting referral work and/or non attendance at an examination, you have no further resit opportunities.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<ol><li><span>In Part 2, once results are confi rmed by an Examining Board, they will remain on your record. <strong>You cannot under any circumstances resit a module you have already passed in order to achieve a higher mark</strong>. You cannot substitute a different module for one you have passed. You may be allowed to take a different module in place of a failed module if you are repeating the year, but any 'F' indicators will need to be attached to the substitute module(s). <br/>
<br/>This means, for example, that you cannot repeat your second year and disregard failed modules unless you have 'H' resits, even if you are changing scheme. If you do wish to change scheme in Part 2 and start afresh on the new scheme, you need to withdraw before the Semester One examining period begins.</span> </li>
<li><span>You may of course ask your department for more information about your performance in your modules and staff should be able to offer advice, for instance, on the strengths and weakness of your performance.</span> </li></ol>


<h2>Resits</h2>
<h3>All Part 1 Students</h3>
<ol><li><span>You may resit on up to <strong>three</strong> further occasions following the initial failure, normally in the supplementary examinations in the year of failure and in the semester and supplementary examinations of the following session.</span> </li></ol>
<h3>Part 2 Entrants</h3>
<ol><li><span>You may resit on one further occasion following the initial failure, normally when the module is examined during the following session. If the module is not offered the following session arrangements will be made with the Department concerned.</span> </li></ol>
<h3>All Students</h3>
<ol><li><ol><li><span>You must inform the Academic Office by 31 October of any modules you wish to resit. If you do not do so but submit coursework or turn up and sit an examination anyway your marks will be cancelled.</span> </li>
<li><span>If you fail to turn up for a resit examination you will forfeit one of your resit opportunities. In Part 2 you will have no further opportunity to sit.</span> </li></ol></li></ol>
<h3>Resit Fees</h3>
<ol><li><span>Note that resit fees are charged for the August Supplementary Examinations (Part 1) and for students resitting the following session (Part 2). These fees will normally be waived in the case of Part 1 students allowed 'M' resits and Part 2 students allowed 'H' resits.</span> </li></ol>


<h2>Unfair Practice</h2>
<ol><li><span>Sadly each year the pressure of exams causes some students to engage in <strong>unfair practice</strong> practice. Cases are dealt with most severely. The following is an extract from the Academic Regulation on Unfair Practice: <br/>
<br/>It is an unfair practice to commit any act whereby a person may obtain, for himself/herself or for another, an unpermitted advantage. This shall apply whether the candidate acts alone or in conjunction with another/others. Any action or actions shall be deemed to fall within this definition, whether occurring during, or in relation to, a formal examination, a piece of coursework, or any form of assessment undertaken in pursuit of a University qualification. <br/>
<br/>Examples of unfair practice are shown below. These are not exhaustive, and other cases may fall within the general definition of unfair practice. </span></li></ol>
<h3>Examples of unfair practice in non-examination conditions </h3>
<ol type="i"><li><span>Plagiarism, which can be defined as using another person's work and presenting it as one's own: examples include</span> <ul type="disc"><li><span>Copying another person's work</span> </li>
<li><span>Unacknowledged translation of another person's work in order to present it as one's own </span></li>
<li><span>Paraphrasing or adapting another person's work without due acknowledgment</span> </li>
<li><span>Unacknowledged use of material downloaded from the internet </span></li>
<li><span>Use of material obtained from essay banks or similar agencies </span></li></ul></li>
<li><span>Collusion: This occurs</span> <ul type="disc"><li><span>When work that has been undertaken by or with others is submitted and passed off as solely the work of one person </span></li>
<li><span>When the work of one candidate is submitted in the name of another; when this is done with the knowledge of the originator, both parties can be considered to be at fault </span></li></ul></li>
<li><span>Fabrication of data, making false claims to have carried out experiments, observations, interviews or other forms of data collection and analysis, or acting dishonestly in any other way</span> </li>
<li><span>Presenting evidence of special circumstances to Examining Boards, which is false or falsified or which is, in any way, intended to mislead Examining Boards</span> </li></ol>
<h3>Examples of unfair practice in examination conditions</h3>
<ol type="i"><li><span>Introducing into an examination room and/or associated facilities any unauthorised form of material such as a book, a manuscript, data or loose papers, information obtained via any electronic device, or any source of unauthorised information </span></li>
<li><span>Copying from, or communicating with, any other person in the examination room and/or associated facilities except as authorised by an invigilator </span></li>
<li><span>Communicating electronically with any other person, except as authorised by an invigilator </span></li>
<li><span>Impersonating an examination candidate or allowing oneself to be impersonated </span></li>
<li><span>Presenting an examination script as one's own work when the script includes material produced by unauthorised means </span></li>
<li><span>Presenting evidence of special circumstances to Examining Boards, which is false or falsified or which is, in any way, intended to mislead Examining Boards </span></li></ol>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry shall apply one, or a combination, of the following penalties: </p>
<ol><li><span>Cancellation of the candidate's marks in part or in whole for any or all assessments taken during the semester or year in question: the Committee should specify whether or not a reassessment is permitted, either for the bare pass mark or for the full mark </span></li>
<li><span>Exclusion of the candidate from the University for a specific period or permanently </span></li>
<li><span>Disqualification of the candidate from any future examination in the University </span></li></ol>
<p>Any candidate who is allowed to resit shall be eligible for the pass mark only.</p>
<ol><li><span>Please make sure you do not fall into the trap of unfair practice. The risks are not worth the penalties. <strong>In particular, you should note that departments will randomly check coursework for unattributed material taken from the Web. Where there is evidence of this penalties will be applied as indicated above</strong>.</span> </li>
<li><span>Departments will issue further guidance on plagiarism and unfair practice. <em>Make sure you familiarise yourself with it</em> - <strong>ignorance will not be accepted as a valid defence</strong>.</span> </li></ol>


<h2>University Statement on Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Plagiarism is the act of using someone else's work with an intent to deceive. In academic contexts, the point of the deception is normally to obtain higher marks than you think you would get for your own unaided efforts. There are several ways of going about this. You might decorate your essay with some choice expressions from some other source(s), without making it clear that you have done this. You might take substantial chunks. You might copy from notes or essays written by fellow students or even taken from the internet. In more extreme cases, students might actually submit work to which they have contributed nothing at all, something that is entirely the work of another mind.</p>
<p>People who do this do it for various motives. A good and ambitious student might do it because s/he desperately wants a very good degree result, and is doubtful if s/he can achieve that on his/her own; or because there is a course in which s/he is relatively weak. A poor student might do it because s/he has been in the pub when s/he ought to have been working and has no work to submit. Sometimes the motives can be very complex. Whatever they are, plagiarism is intellectual dishonesty.</p>
<p>There is of course a very real risk of plagiarism being detected. A student may feel that s/he will get away with downloading material from the Internet and presenting it as his/her own work. But it is probably worth noting that if you fi nd it there then the lecturer setting the topic in the first place is also aware of it.</p>
<p>Similarly if you copy a fellow student's work, the chances of it being spotted are very high indeed.</p>
<p>No intellectual endeavour is ever absolutely original. Even the most original minds depend on the thoughts and discoveries of their predecessors. And in most intellectual disciplines, students are expected to demonstrate familiarity with the established literature in their fi eld: indeed, this is one of the key competences that you need to demonstrate in most academic fields. Most of the time, you will be citing articles and books that are especially relevant to your enquiry, and making your own contribution to it. That contribution might not be a great one, especially in the early years of a degree programme; but it will, or should, be your own.</p>
<p><strong>Each Department will have its own subject-specific account of the best ways in which to avoid plagiarism, appearing elsewhere in the Departmental Handbook and you should familiarise yourself with it.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes students can be so weak or under-confi dent in a subject, again especially early on in their studies, that they really fi nd it diffi cult to tell what is acceptable borrowing from other sources and what is not. Sometimes, unacceptable degrees of borrowing can occur when a student has not actually intended to engage in unfair practice. For this reason, when a member of the academic staff reads work that s/he suspects is not the unaided work of its supposed author, s/he may not at once notify this to the Chairman of the relevant Examining Board but may discuss it fi rst with the student. University staff will exercise proper academic judgement.</p>
<p>If and when s/he decides to do so, the Chair will normally interview the student in the presence of the staff member making the enquiry, to establish whether there was an intention to benefi t unfairly. The panel may decide that there was not. This, they may then think, is not <strong>unfair</strong>, but <strong>bad</strong> practice. They will probably assign an appropriately low mark to the examined element. If, however, the panel is convinced that there is on the face of it a case of unfair practice, and if the course element constitutes more than 20 credits' worth of the overall assessment weighting for the year of study, the Chairman will notify the University authorities and what happens next will be governed by the University's Academic Regulation on Unfair Practice. The most signifi cant part of this is reproduced in this Handbook. If a case of plagiarism is established, the penalties can be very severe indeed and can result in your permanent exclusion from the University.</p>
<p>Where the assessed element is worth 20 credits or less, departments are authorised to handle the case wholly internally, unless the student chooses to appear before the University's Unfair Practice Committee. In most such cases, the mark for the assessed element will be 0 with possibly no opportunity to resit. More severe punishments may also be imposed (<abbr title="For Example">e.g.</abbr> 0 for the module as a whole).</p>
<p>Clearly, however, the most sensible course for a student to pursue, and the course that most students do pursue, is to develop enough academic judgement and self-confi dence for them not to be in any danger of such an accusation being made against them. Most students have no wish to gain credit for what they have not themselves contributed, or to gain a qualifi cation that is, even in part, a bogus achievement.</p>


<h2>Appeals</h2>
<ol><li><span>The University has an <strong>appeals system</strong> as defined by the Academic Regulation on Academic Progress (see above). <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Please note that all appeals must be made within fourteen days of the publication of results. You cannot appeal against your Semester 1 results at the end of the session.</strong> <br/>
<br/>"Appeals will only be considered if a student can provide good reasons why the grounds for appeal were not make known to the relevant Examining Board before it made its decision. <br/>
<br/>Students are entitled to seek verification of the fact that relevant circumstances which might have adversely affected their examination performance and which had been previously notified to departments were taken into account by the Examining Boards concerned. <br/>
<br/>In their own interests therefore students should make every effort to ensure that they inform their departments in writing <strong>before the meeting of the relevant Examining Boards</strong> of any factors which may have an adverse effect on examination performance." <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Note that it is your responsibility to inform all your departments of special circumstances which may affect your work or progress</strong> progress. Failure to do so may have disastrous results for you and only cause you problems later. All such information will be treated confi dentially and used to ensure the fullest possible consideration of your overall performance. The Special Circumstances Form and Notes for Guidance can be seen on <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic/specialcircumstances/">www.aber.ac.uk/en/academic/specialcircumstances/</a> <br/>
<br/>If you choose to keep such information from your departments, you cannot subsequently submit an appeal claiming you were embarrassed or did not feel it important. Appeals based on grounds which could reasonably have been notified to departments beforehand will be rejected rejected. Please make sure you keep your departments informed.</span> </li>
<li><span>This of course is just one facet of the mutual responsibilities between University and student. We have a policy of openness in our procedures and we expect you to behave similarly towards us.</span> </li>
<li><span>There is a slightly different procedure for appeals against the result of your final degree examinations. Here candidates must first seek verification of their result against the following criteria: <br/>
<br/>A candidate in a University examination is entitled to ask for verifi cation of one or more of the following:</span> <ol><li><span>That the assessment published by the University is free of arithmetical or other errors of fact.</span> </li>
<li><span>That the examiners were aware of exceptional personal circumstances reported by the student prior to the meeting of the Examining Board(s) concerned and which might in his/her opinion have had an adverse effect on his/her academic performance.</span> </li>
<li><span>That the examiners were aware of defects or irregularities in the conduct of the examinations or in written advice relating thereto, when such defects or irregularities or advice can be shown to have had an adverse effect on the candidate's performance.</span> </li></ol>
<span>Evidence of exceptional personal circumstances not previously reported will not normally be accepted as the basis of an appeal unless there are good grounds for explaining why the student was unable to report them before the meeting of the relevant Examining Board. <br/>
<br/>Candidates may proceed to the formal appeal stage only after verifi cation of their degree.</span> </li></ol>

<h2>Special Needs</h2>

<p>Students with special needs should read the booklet 'Examinations for Students with Special Needs' available from the Academic Office and on the web (www.aber.ac.uk/en/student/exam/), which explains particular arrangements which may be made for you to perform to your utmost in exams. </p>
<h2>
Past Papers</h2>

<p>Past exam papers are available for consultation in the Library and in some cases over the web. These should give you an idea of the type of question set in the past. Please do not attempt to 'question spot'. You are likely to be unlucky and that way lies disaster. For further advice on what your examiners are looking for ask your tutors. Many departments run special exam seminars to address student concerns and clarify departmental requirements. Please attend them where they are offered - they are after all for your benefit not the staff's!
Please remember: we want you to perform to the best of your ability, but we expect you to be responsible for your studies and to keep your departments and the Registry informed.
If you have problems, you will find most staff approachable but in fairness to everybody your success lies ultimately in your own hands, and depends on the way you work and respond to the challenges laid before you. </p></textarea>
